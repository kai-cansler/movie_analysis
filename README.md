# Movie Analysis for Microsoft Studios


## Overview
In the growing landscape of original video content and streaming it is our new project to start our own movie studio. It is important to understand what movies perform well and how they perform. This will give us the overview in understanding our entry into this market.

## Business Problem
We will be exploring what types of films perform the best at the box office to see which genres perform with the best return on investment. A analysis of what movies perform best with certain demographics will help us understand what audience we would like to target for our new film creations. We will use these findings to create a business strategy that will help Microsoft Studios flourish.

## Data
The MovieDB and IMDB datasets to complete our exploratory data analysis. These two datasets will provide a comprehensive picture on what movies perform and which genre they are along with the ratings these movies earned.

## Method
This project uses descriptive analysis, including group by commands to understand how genres as a whole affects return on investment and net profit. We will also use these techniques to look at what month would be the best to release a movie in terms of generating highest net profit. Lastly we will look at how budget and runtime affect the net profit of a movie.

## Conclusion
From our exploratory data analysis we have found some valuable insights from our movie datasets. 

Our first question was which movie genres offer best ROI and Net Profit. We found that Mystery, Horror, and Thriller offer the highest ROI out of the other genres ranging from 500% to even 850%! After taking a look at genres and Net Profit we found that the genres with highest Net Profit are Animation,  Adventure, and Sci-Fi movies. The visualization also shows our Highest ROI genres dont make nearly as close as the highest Net Profit. My recommendation is that with lower budgets we should focus on producing Myster, Horror, and Thriller films to generate the highest return on investment. This could offer us the cashflow and capital to invest into production budgets for films such as Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi who bring in much larger Net Profit but are significantly more costly to make. By utilizing these two focuses we can effectively use our capital for projects that will be beneficial for the success of our studio.

The second question was what month would be the best time to release our new projects. A movies release will be a important factor in its success. With the costs of advertising we want to ensure that we time everything to maximize the most value we can get from it. This means that releasing movies in times when we have the highest amount of viewership will be beneficial in spreading our film through word of mouth and ensuring our movie stays popular. We found through our analysis that movies released in the Summer and Winter months have had the most success in Net Profit. Movies released in July had by far the best success in terms of Net Profit. This could be seen from a multitude of factors such as summer being a popular time for employees to take vacation and school is also closed for summer vacation. To make sure we drive as many people as possible through advertisement of our movie we should schedule the production to be released in July.

The last question was how budget and runtime minutes of a movie will affect the Net Profit of a movie. This will inform us on how to strategize how long we should make our production and how large we should make our production budgets. The average runtime minutes for the top 50 movies is 125.98 minutes and the average production budget is $174.764 million. For our large movie projects aiming for high net profit the investment should be at least 174.764 million dollars with a runtime of at least 125.98 minutes. This will give us the best opportunity to earn a high net profit for our film.
